One of the most interesting team projects I worked on was during university, where we built a system to solve an assignment problem using linear programming in Excel and Python.
The goal was to assign students to exam topics in a way that maximizes the average preparedness, based on a matrix of scores representing how well each student is prepared for each topic.

We developed an interactive application that allows users to define the score matrix and constraints, and it computes the optimal assignment using linear programming.
My responsibility was to implement the optimization logic in VBA inside Excel. I wrote the algorithm that finds the best matching between students and topics.
I also created the graphical user interface in Python using Tkinter, which allows users to input data, run the algorithm, and visualize the results.

The project involved both algorithm design and user experience aspects, and required close cooperation within the team to integrate the Excel-based backend with the Python frontend.
I learned a lot about optimization techniques, working with different technologies, and how to coordinate in a team to deliver a working solution.
